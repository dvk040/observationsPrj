							AJAX
							=====

What is AJAX?
    - AJAX stands for 'Asynchronous JavaScript And Xml'.
    - It is a technique of exchanging data between client and server, asynchronously (in background).


When AJAX was born?
    - In 2006


What is the user-experience with AJAX:
    - If AJAX is used in the page, browser internally in background send an 'asynchronous request' to the server and get response asynchronously.
    - User will not feel that the page is refreshing / re-loading


What is the advantage of AJAX?
    - User experience will be improved a lot.
    - Less burden on the internet connections, server and client, as we exchange light-weight data (the data which needs to be sent or received only will be exchanged).



What is jQuery AJAX?
    - jQuery (a popular java script library) has necessary methods (functions) to implement AJAX in the page.
    - To work with this, you need to just import "jquery core script file" (Ex: jquery-1.9.1.min.js"). No extra files required.


==============================================================

Syntax of jQuery AJAX:

	$.ajax(
	     {
			url: "server url here",
			type: "GET/POST", //type of request
			contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8", //content type sent to server
			dataType: "json", //Expected data format from server
			success: ServiceSucceeded, //On Success
			error: ServiceFailed // On exception
	    }
	);

	function ServiceSucceeded (response)
	{
		//do something with response here
	}

	function ServiceFailed(xhr)
	{
		alert(xhr.responseText);
        }
