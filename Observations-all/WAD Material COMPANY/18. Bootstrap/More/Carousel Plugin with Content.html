The first generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007; the most recent iPhone models are the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which were unveiled at a special event on September 9, 2014.

						<h2>Android</h2>

						<p class="lead">Android is a mobile operating system (OS) based on the Linux kernel and currently developed by Google. With a user interface based on direct manipulation, Android is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, with specialized user interfaces for televisions (Android TV), cars (Android Auto), and wrist watches (Android Wear). The OS uses touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, and a virtual keyboard.</p>

						<h2>Windows Phone</h2>

						<p class="lead">Windows Phone is a mobile operating system developed by Microsoft for smartphones as the replacement successor to Windows Mobile. Windows Phone features a new user interface derived from the Microsoft-developed "Modern" design language (formerly known as "Metro"). Unlike Windows Mobile, it is primarily aimed at the consumer market rather than the enterprise market. It was first launched in October 2010 with Windows Phone 7. Windows Phone 8.1 is the latest public release of the operating system, and was delivered in final form to developers on April 14 2014. It will be available for update to all devices previously running Windows Phone 8.</p>
